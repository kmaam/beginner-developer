## Simple Calculator Code Explain

Sure! Let's go step-by-step and explain this HTML code **bit by bit**, using **very simple English** — 

---

## 🌐 What is this?    

This is a **simple calculator webpage**. It lets you:

* Type two numbers (like 5 and 3)
* Pick an operation (like + or -)
* Click a button
* Then it shows you the answer (like 5 + 3 = 8)

Now let’s break it down step by step. 👇

---

## 🟢 `<html lang="en">`

This tells the browser:

> “This is an HTML file, and the language used is English.”

---

## 🟢 `<head>` and what’s inside it

The `<head>` section is **invisible** to the user. It sets things up for the webpage to work properly.

Let’s look inside:

### ✅ `<meta charset="UTF-8" />`

This line makes sure the webpage can show all letters and symbols correctly (like emojis, special letters).

### ✅ `<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />`

This line tells the browser:

> "Use the best, latest way to show this page."

### ✅ `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`

This helps the webpage look good on **phones and tablets**, not just computers.

### ✅ `<title>Simple Calculator</title>`

This sets the **title** of the page. You see it in the **browser tab**.

👉 It will say: “Simple Calculator”

### ✅ `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />`

This line **connects to the CSS file**.

CSS makes the page look nice (colors, layout, fonts, etc.)

It’s saying:

> “Use the styles from the file called `style.css`.”

---

## 🟢 `<body>` and what's inside

This is what the user actually **sees on the page**. Let’s break it down:

### ✅ `<div class="main">`

This is a **big container box**. Everything inside it belongs to the calculator.

---

### 📦 Inside the main box:

#### ✅ `<div class="inputs">`

This holds all the inputs — like typing numbers and picking math symbols.

#### ✅ `<h1 class="result">Result</h1>`

This shows the **result** (the answer of the calculation).
Right now, it just says “Result” — later, JavaScript will change it.

---

#### ✅ `<select id="selectOp">`

This is a **dropdown menu**. You can pick an operation:

* ➕ (plus)
* ➖ (minus)
* ➗ (divide)
* ✖️ (multiply)

##### Inside this dropdown:

```html
<option value="plus">+</option>
<option value="min">-</option>
<option value="dev">/</option>
<option value="multi">*</option>
```

These are the choices the user can select.

---

#### ✅ Two input boxes:

```html
<input type="number" class="num1" placeholder="Number 1" />
<input type="number" class="num2" placeholder="Number 2" />
```

These let the user type two numbers.

Example:

* First box: 5
* Second box: 3

---

### ✅ The Submit Button:

```html
<div class="submitBtn">
  <button id="btn">Submit</button>
</div>
```

This is the button that the user **clicks to calculate**.

---

## 🟢 JavaScript connection:

```html
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

This connects to a file called `app.js`.
That file has JavaScript — the part that **does the math** when you click the button.

---

## 📦 Summary

This HTML file builds a small calculator webpage that:

1. Takes two numbers from the user
2. Lets them pick +, -, *, or /
3. Click a button
4. Shows the answer

It uses:

* **HTML** to build the structure
* **CSS** (linked in `style.css`) to style it
* **JavaScript** (in `app.js`) to do the math

---

Would you like me to explain the `app.js` file too? I can break that down the same way.
